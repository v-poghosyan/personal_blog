### ðŸ“™ About this blog

This blog is where I write about the subjects that interest me. It's where I collect my notes and ideas on the web. I started it in late 2021 from some notes I took in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Most of the content will be centered around machine learning, however I will expand into other subject areas as well. In the spirit of AI (and scalability) the thumbnails and other images featured in this blog are generated using DALL-E.
