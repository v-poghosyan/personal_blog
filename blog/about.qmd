Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vahram, a software engineer and graduate student of Computer Science at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) with a deep-rooted passion for mathematics of machine learning and the applied sciences in general.

This blog is where I write about the subjects that interest me. It's where I collect my notes and ideas on the web.

I started it in late 2021 from some notes I took with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). From there it was only a small effort to publish them via Fastpages, a blogging platform powered by Jekyll. In 2023, I migrated the blog from the now deprecated Fastpages to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs).
